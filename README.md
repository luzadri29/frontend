# Overview

In this project you will connect to an open API and build a small **React** app to query the API.
You have 2 hours and 15 minutes from when you received this file to complete and upload the project.

# Project Summary

Please **fetch a list of companies from https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/companies and create a web page that displays information about 12 companies.** You can find API documentation here: https://fakerapi.it/en

We're looking less for depth of complexity and more for a complete project. **Documentation, testing, JS and CSS expertise, and good organization are key criteria we'll be looking for.**

We have included the configuration for a Create React App project in the `./frontend` folder. Navigate to `./frontend` and run `npm install` (or `yarn`, if you have it) to get started. Initializing your project can take a few minutes so you may want to start the install now.

Feel free to add any additional libraries you would like, for example, additional testing libraries, CSS frameworks, component libraries, or CSS preprocessors, etc.

# Evaluation Criteria

The following are the evaluation criteria:

- Repository is version controlled with Git **(1 point)**
- Data is fetched from an API endpoint using the method of your choice **(2 points)**
- Project design rationale in a `SOLUTION.md` **(1 point)**
- Data from the API is displayed in the react application **(1 points)**
- Organized project structure **(1 point)**
- Well composed React components **(2 points)**
- Each component is documented at least a small amount (JSDoc optional) **(2 points)**
- Inline comments for complex code **(1 point)**
- At least one component is tested **(2 points)**
- Design is coherent with good UX and accessibility **(up to 3 points)**
- CSS is well structured and uses any of the following: BEM, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, the CSS preprocessor of your choice, or the CSS framework of your choice **(2 points)**

## Bonus Points

- Responsive design **(1 point)**
- Using CSS Grid **(1 point)**
- Routing **(1 point)**
- Error handling **(1 point)**

Note: it's a good idea to choose a smaller scope for the project to give you time to focus on testing, documentation, and clean, well organized code.

## Not Important

- Don't worry about cross browser compatibility
- Don't worry about fetching any additional data
- Don't worry about spending too much time on complex visuals

# Testing

Create React App comes with Jest installed. You may add additional testing libraries if you'd like. The simplest way to create a test is to create a `<component>.test.js` and run `npm test` (or `yarn test`). See https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/ for more info.

# Upload Instructions

If you aren't able to complete the entire exercise, that's alright. Upload your progress so far and we can discuss in the review interview.

- Upload your project to a private GitLab or GitHub repo.

**OR**

- Zip and share the share the zip file via email. (Make sure **NOT** to include your `frontend/node_modules` folder!)
