# Overview

Create a new react project for fetching data from an API

In order for fetch the data, I'm using fetch and response.json for formating the response into json javascript object. Validating with try catch.
Then create a hook for manage state with useState.
Call and wait the data with useEffect hook.
Return the companies data in the function return in a card format. 
-using the name as title
-the following attributes as text.

I use reactstrap library to do some styling when displaing the companies information.
